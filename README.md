## My freeCodeCamp.org projects

Projects I completed as part of the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)

* Tribute Page: A simple page with a centered size responsive image and an external link.
* Survey Form: A survey form with different input types (text, number, email, radio and check buttons...) and a dropdown (no JS).
